@WindyDiego So for me it's because he took over at a time when we made a European final and we have regressed in Europe ever since. He also give himself a pay rise during covid at a time the club had it's earnings cut in half. Finally it's his tendency to completely ignore the fans.
@CaporalGroulx @WeAreCanProud @ikwilson Govt/medis told you 1). shots would stop transmission &amp; infection. Cases increased after vaccine rollout.  That wasn't true. 2). They told you shots stop serious illness &amp; death.  Fully vaccinated patients in covid pods prove otherwise. That wasn't true.  Which part is true??
